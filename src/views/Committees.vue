          Would you like to make the most of your student life, and experience what it is to work
          together with other students to make great things happen? If so, then perhaps joining a
          committee is something for you! Committees are groups of students that work together to
          organize events or provide services for the association, while also having a lot of fun
          and getting some professional experience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body-1">
          If you would like to join a meeting to see if we are something for you, or if you have a
          question, feel free to contact the board at
