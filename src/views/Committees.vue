          Would you like to make the most of your student life, and experience what it is to work
          together with other students to make great things happen? If so, then perhaps joining a
          committee is something for you! Committees are groups of students that work together to
          organize events or provide services for the association, while also having a lot of fun
          and getting some professional experience. </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          If you would like to join a meeting to see if we are something for you, or if you have a
          question, feel free to contact the board at
          <a href="mailto:internal-affairs@blueshell.utwente.nl">internal-affairs@blueshell.utwente.nl</a>
          . You could also ask us on Discord or in person at one of the events.

            <v-expansion-panel-content><p>The LegaCie, some call it the backbone of Blueshell,
              others will just say it is a bunch of people that like to organize a good party. That’s
              why the LegaCie organizes the monthly gamenights. Of course the gamenights should be
              held to the highest of standards, that’s why this is one the largest committees in all
              of Blueshell! But, you might ask, what does the LegaCie really do? They make sure all
              games are working during the gamenight, make reservations, create an amazing pubquiz
              from time to time and all the other background stuff you wouldn't even know
              exists.</p>
              <p><b>Why join?</b></p>
              <p>As said before this is one of the largest committees in Blueshell and we can always
                use more people! If you have a great idea for a gamenight like a theme or special
                game, or if you just want to help out a bit you should definitely join the
                committee!</p>

              this one but also develop a new website! This is of course still highly experimental and
              will not see any implementation in the near future. However, in the end, this will
              create an amazing new platform that looks even better.</p>
              <p><b>Why join?</b></p>
              <p>Joining this committee does not require you to have any previous knowledge of
                coding a website, you will learn this along the way. What you do require is the
                enthusiasm to work with a team on something like this and make it great!</p>
