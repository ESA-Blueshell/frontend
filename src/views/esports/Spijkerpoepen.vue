          It all started in the good old town of Westerbork. Back then, it was still the 90s, so my
          uncle Kees wore a fannypack with spare nails connected to wires. He was a local carpenter,
          however he was very absent-minded, so he lost his nails very quickly. He always had
          problems with his Hemorrhoids during our family barbeques. One time he decided to quickly
          release his pressure in the half-empty beer bottle he put on the ground. He tried to align
          his ass to open the floodgates, but by accident dropped the nail in the beerbottle. Me and
          my multiple wives found it so funny that we joined in the fun. And the rest is history. By
          now Spijkerpoepen is one of the most grossed esports globally. Annually more than 6
          gorrilion zimbamwanese dollars are gifted in price pools. Fans all over the world watch
          live streams and stadiums are sold completely filled to the brim watching the breathtaking
          teamfights take place. The game has grown rapidly and produced a lot of merchandise, music
          and asian cartoons. Last year during the Worlds 2020 the champions of 2003 "Normaal"
          performed a song in celebration of the 25th anniversary called "Godverdomme, woar doe ik
          het veur".
