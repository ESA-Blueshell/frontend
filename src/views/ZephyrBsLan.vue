        <p class="text-h4 font-weight-light">
          Schedule</p>
        <p class="body-1">
          We are still working on making a full schedule, but you can see what events we have planned in the schedule
          page.</p>

        <p class="text-h4 font-weight-light">
          Accommodations</p>
        <p class="body-1">
          There will be toilets and showers in the SSCE which are available to use during the event. The showers can be
          found in the changing rooms accessible during SSCE opening times. If you want to have any alcoholic drinks,
          they will need to be purchased at the bar when it is open, please note that it is not allowed to bring any
          glass into the LAN hall itself.</p>

        <p class="text-h4 font-weight-light">
          Sleeping possibilities</p>
        <p class="body-1">
          The hall will be separated to have a LAN and a sleeping area by a big curtain. During the night the organized
          activities will be taking this into account, but please note that you will still be sleeping in the same hall,
          in which it will not be silent and can still be distracting at most times.</p>

        <p class="text-h4 font-weight-light">
          Getting there</p>
        <p class="body-1">
          In order to get your <i>epic gaming equipment™</i> from Enschede/Hengelo to the LAN, 2 vans will be arranged
          which will be able to transport all the equipment you want to the LAN (until they are full of course). This
          van will, at the end of the LAN, also be used to transport the equipment back to Enschede/Hengelo.</p>
        <p class="body-1">
          Getting there yourself should however be arranged by yourself, whether this is alone or together with others
          by train, car or something else that is able to transport you there. The costs of these travels cannot be
          declared with the LAN as of now. It is possible that this will happen if the budget at the end of LAN
          allows for it, but do not count on this! We will update you whether this is the case once the LAN is over.</p>

        <p class="text-h4 font-weight-light">
          Accessibility</p>
        <p class="body-1">
          You can access the SSCE via the Tu/e campus, the backdoor is not available this year!! Once you reach the SSCE
          gate on campus, see the red circle, you can unload your things and we’ll have a pulley or something ready to
          bring your stuff to the front door. From there it's only a couple of steps to hall 2.
        </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          The Tu/e has half an hour of free parking, so the place to put your car after unloading would be the Onze
          Lieve Vrouwenstraat behind the SSCE, see the orange line. From there, you can easily come back to the SSCE on
          foot, see the purple arrow.
