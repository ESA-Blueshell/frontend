          Who are we? Before I, like, start talking about myself, I need to talk about my core
          values. What are core values? They are the bread and butter of any association. Core
          values makes sure you never have to read the statuten ever again or care about already
          pre-existing rules. Therefore we came up with the ones defining shitshell:
        <ul>
          <li>Gaming</li>
          <li>Gamers</li>
          <li>Gamboys</li>
          <li>Gaymurs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          My name is Shitshell. Just like any turtle, I was born on the beaches of normandy in 1944.
          It was a beatiful day, the sun shined, I felt good cracking my eggshells to say hello to
          the world. Unfortunately it was not the day for my brothers and sisters. Britbongs and
          Amerifats stormed the beaches and trampled all my brothers and sisters to death. Only one
          sibling of mine survived, Shelly. She survived the shellslaughter, but due to a br*t
          strumbling across his own feet and landing on my little onee-chan, that c*nt's disgusting
          yellow croocked teeth penetrated her brains and ever since then she has been diagnosed
          with type 7 PDD-NOS on Richter's magnitude scale. From that moment, our relationship was
          always difficult. She swam between the cool shells on the block, while I was a social
          outcast. She got all the attention from feminist whales, tsundere sharks, clownfish and
          even squids (no idea what their plan was, but I used to be innocent). Shelly, despite her
          crippling autism, grew up to be a fine lady. More and more sea creatures became part of
          her social circle and I slowly became more and more an angry incel. She started this
          community called "Blueshell", named after the color her shell becomes after she chokes
          herself when eating a frikandelbroodje. She started to expand this social circle by
          hosting videogame tournaments and other activities with her friends, she now called
          members. I wasn't going to have any of it. If I cannot be part of the fun, I will make
          sure to ruin it. That's why I sneakily became part of her clique. I needed to make sure to
          disrupt any "fun" these cringe members were having. So I became a shitposter, the one that
          smears this association with shit and makes it reek at every corner. Now finally it was my
          time to shine. I infiltrated the SiteCie (wasn't difficult if you password is literally
          your username... what are these SiteCie goons, baby boomers?) and found myself exploring
          the source code of the website. Interesting........ So this is what is the holy site for
          these "members", huh?
        </p>
        <p>
          So, it is time for me to plot the next triggering. I will jebait them in coming to the
          site, and until the time strikes, I will be lurking in the shadows.
